# UsersChurnPrediction
Using the Applicant Data of an app to build a churn detection/prediction model that can serve as an early detection system for app users at risk of churning.

METHODOLOGY:
1. Data Interaction
2. Handling missing Values
   - Using Mean and Mode Values.
4. Feature Enginnering
   - Creating and defining the Variable 'Churn'
   - Creating other important variables they will be important for feature selection.
6. Feature Selection
   -Filter Methode : HeatMap/Correlation map.
   - Embedded methode : RandomForest Classifier(Feature Importance)
8. Predictive Model
   - Feature Scaling : Standard Scaler
   - Double layered Neural Networks : Modeling and Evaluation.
   - Gradient Boosting(XGBoost) : Modeling and Evaluation.
   - Logistic Regression : Modeling and Evaluation.
   - Spport Vector Machines : Modeling and Evaluation.
   - Visualizing Confusion Metrics for all Algorithms.
